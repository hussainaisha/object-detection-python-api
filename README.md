# Object Detection with Flask and Tensorflow 2.0 (APIs and Detections)
Yolov3 is an algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. This repository implements Yolov3 using TensorFlow 2.0 and creates two easy-to-use APIs that you can integrate into web or mobile applications. <br>

## Getting started

#### Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Tensorflow CPU
conda env create -f conda-cpu.yml
conda activate yolov3-cpu

# Tensorflow GPU
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
conda activate yolov3-gpu
```

#### Pip
```bash
# TensorFlow CPU
pip install -r requirements.txt

# TensorFlow GPU
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
```

### Nvidia Driver (For GPU, if you haven't set it up already)
```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04
sudo apt-add-repository -r ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-430
# Windows/Other
https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
```
### Downloading official pretrained weights
For Linux: Let's download official yolov3 weights pretrained on COCO dataset. 

```
# yolov3
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights -O weights/yolov3.weights

# yolov3-tiny
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights -O weights/yolov3-tiny.weights
```

Add your custom weights file to weights folder and your custom .names file into data/labels folder.
  
### Saving your yolov3 weights as a TensorFlow model.
Load the weights using `load_weights.py` script. This will convert the yolov3 weights into TensorFlow .ckpt model files!

```
# yolov3
python load_weights.py

# yolov3-tiny
python load_weights.py --weights ./weights/yolov3-tiny.weights --output ./weights/yolov3-tiny.tf --tiny
```

After executing one of the above lines, you should see .tf files in your weights folder.

## Running the Flask App and Using the APIs
Now you can run a Flask application to create two object detections APIs in order to get detections through REST endpoints.
Initialize and run the Flask app on port 5000 of your local machine by running the following command from the root directory of this repo in a command prompt or shell.
```bash
python app.py
```
### Detections API (http://localhost:5000/detections)
While app.py is running the first available API is a POST routed to /detections on port 5000 of localhost. This endpoint takes in images as input and returns a JSON response with all the detections found within each image (classes found within the images and the associated confidence)

You can test out the APIs using Postman or through Curl commands (both work fine). You may have to download them if you don't already have them.


## Running just the TensorFlow model
The tensorflow model can also be run not using the APIs but through using `detect.py` script. 

Don't forget to set the IoU (Intersection over Union) and Confidence Thresholds within your yolov3-tf2/models.py file

```bash
load_weights.py:
  --output: path to output
    (default: './weights/yolov3.tf')
  --[no]tiny: yolov3 or yolov3-tiny
    (default: 'false')
  --weights: path to weights file
    (default: './weights/yolov3.weights')
  --num_classes: number of classes in the model
    (default: '80')
    (an integer)

detect.py:
  --classes: path to classes file
    (default: './data/labels/coco.names')
  --images: path to input images as a string with images separated by ","
    (default: 'data/images/dog.jpg')
  --output: path to output folder
    (default: './detections/')
  --[no]tiny: yolov3 or yolov3-tiny
    (default: 'false')
  --weights: path to weights file
    (default: './weights/yolov3.tf')
  --num_classes: number of classes in the model
    (default: '80')
    (an integer)
